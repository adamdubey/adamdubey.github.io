I"<p>Welcome to my little slice of the Internet!</p>

<p>I’ve actually haven’t worked on this project in awhile unfortunately, so I wanted to take a moment to actually have a meaningful blog post to re-introduce this site. The purpose of this project site is to capture and document various technical projects that I encounter, and occationally write personal blog posts.</p>

<p>Hopefully you will be entertained, and maybe even learn something new! Be sure to check out the project write-ups <a href="/projects/">here</a>.</p>
