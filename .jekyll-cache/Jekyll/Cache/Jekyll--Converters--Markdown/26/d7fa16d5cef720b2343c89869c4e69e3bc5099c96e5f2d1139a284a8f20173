I"™<p>Welcome to my little slice of the Internet!</p>

<p>I am a software/electrical engineer, with an endless curiosity to create and tinker with hardware and software solutions.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project site is to capture and document various technical projects that I encounter, mainly for future reference as well as educational value.</p>

<p>Hopefully you will be entertained along the way!</p>
