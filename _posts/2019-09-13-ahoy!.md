Welcome to my little slice of the Internet!

I am a computer scientist/software engineer, with an endless curiosity to create and tinker with hardware and software solutions.

The purpose of this project site is to capture and document various technical projects that I encounter, mainly for future reference as well as educational value.

Hopefully you will be entertained along the way!
