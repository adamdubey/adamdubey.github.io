Welcome back.
Certainly glad you could find your way here! Clearly things look a bit different now running on Hugo than they did on the older Jekyll iteration of this site&amp;hellip;
So Why the change?
Mainly due to Jekyll being a maintaince nightmare at times, and I wanted to learn a new technology to reduce the bloat and maintanince.
Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a lot more posts and project write-ups that haven&amp;rsquo;t found thier way on here just yet due to time constraints (Bay Area commutes are no joke), however I&amp;rsquo;m working on changing this so that I am able to have the time to learn and write more - and of course publish!</description></item><item><title>Deploying a React app with GitHub Pages</title><link>https://www.adamdubey.github.io/projects/deploy-react-to-gh-pages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adamdubey.github.io/projects/deploy-react-to-gh-pages/</guid><description>With a few hours to kill on a lazy Sunday afternoon&amp;hellip;
GitHub Pages makes it very easy to quickly deploy a web application that only needs a front-end, which is a great medium to use if you for example, wanted to showcase an app or two for an online web developer portfolio.
While you can pretty much use any front-end framework and deploy to GitHub Pages, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to use React.</description></item></channel></rss>
