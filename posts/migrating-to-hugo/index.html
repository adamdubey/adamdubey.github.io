<p><em>I've really put this project off for too long&hellip;</em></p>
<p><img src="procrastinating.gif" alt="procrastinating"></p>
<p>It's finally time to migrate my blog (<em>this site</em>) to Hugo from Jekyll. The primary reason and desire to do this is simply because I have just grown tired of juggling all of the nuances with the Ruby/Jekyll ecosystems. While I still support a few project sites powered by Jekyll, I'd rather focus more on crafting content for my blog and less effort on maintenance.</p>
<p>So Hugo, welcome - glad you are the solution here! I've yet to spend more than a few hours tinkering with this tech stack, but overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's fast and intuitive</li>
<li>gentle learning curve (pick a theme you like, and follow the basic example structures provided)</li>
<li>way less bloat than you get with the Ruby/Jekyll stack</li>
</ul>
<p>Well with some extra time in the schedule, and it currently being Summer, I felt inspired to set a fun challenge to tackle this migration&hellip; a Hackathon!</p>
<h2 id="my-summer-hackathon-2020-a-new-challenger-appears">My Summer Hackathon 2020: A new challenger appears!</h2>
<p>Okay, this is starting to become exciting - dedicate a few days to just primarily focus on this migration project and take care of some housekeeping with a bit of backlogged material, and bonus points to aligning the event with the weekend to get a few late nights of work in.</p>
<p><img src="hackathon.gif" alt="hackathon"></p>
<p><strong>Project Outline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup Hugo/template framework</li>
<li>Configuration details</li>
<li>Migrate existing posts/projects</li>
<li>Establish deployment workflow</li>
<li>Bonus Points for CI/CD integration (<em>it'll happen either way üòè</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My proposed schedule:</strong></p>
<p><em>Basically just mixing the Olympics with a Hackathon&hellip;</em></p>
<p>I felt this to be a good balance of dedicated time to allocate, especially since I still have to go to work and deal with some other ongoing projects. All in all, I think I could've cut a day out of this and still would be fine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 0: 18 June</li>
<li>Day 1: 19 June</li>
<li>Day 2: 20 June</li>
<li>Day 3: 21 June</li>
<li>Day 4: 22 June</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the target goal is 80% of the migration in a completed state, I don't want to rush this, and am purposely setting the stage to just enjoy working through any challenges that come my way. Additionally, I don't anticipate deploying the site until a few days afterwards just so I can cross-check everything before launch.</p>
<h2 id="deploying-">Deploying üöÄ</h2>
<p>It seems there are a few ways of deploying a Hugo site&hellip;? Yeah I don't know what the most pragmatic approach to deployments is, since the official documentation doesn't quite make it easy for just a single repo site hosting because all the variations I've tried ended as <code>failure to launch</code>.</p>
<p><img src="wtf-deployment.gif" alt="wtf-deployment"></p>
<p><em>I want my Hugo blog damnit!</em></p>
<p>However, when it came time to deploy this time I got it on the first try! üòç</p>
<p>Here are the steps I took to deliver a successful deployment:</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You only need to deploy the contents of <code>/public</code> onto the <code>master</code> branch!</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>hugo</code> to build the site and produce the <code>/public</code> artifact</li>
<li>You only need to deploy the contents of <code>/public</code>;</li>
<li>Lazy way is to just copy/pasta the files from <code>/public</code> over to the root project directory</li>
<li>Commit &amp; Push;</li>
<li>Follow typical PR workflow to merge into <code>master</code></li>
</ol>
<p>And that's it&hellip; that was the &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; that worked for me. So far it's been the only process that has worked every time for just <em>&ldquo;Hugo blog + Github Pages hosting&rdquo;</em> deployments. Now it's certainly not the most glamorous way of going about it, but it's easy to automate based on your workflow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I ran short on time to really focus on building and defining a CI/CD pipeline for this project, and just haven't implemented anything quite yet. At some point I'll have some form of git hook + CI server to perform the heavy lifting and management of building. You can get a sense of all sorts of variations and possibilities around automating your workflow&hellip; The sky's the limit as to what you can automate!</p>
<h2 id="results--reflections">Results &amp; Reflections</h2>
<p>Wow, what a huge difference! I found my workflows with Hugo way more streamlined than before with Jekyll, which is a huge plus! üëç Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention not having to worry about several different flavors of syntax, just Markdown and Yaml (<em>for the most part</em>).</p>
<p>Overall I really enjoyed framing this project as a Hackathon. Sometimes it really helps to just change your frame of mind as frankly I haven't been feeling inspired to do much work on personal projects. Simply just dedicating a few days of just exclusively work on this project, I was able to complete the migration quickly and really reignite a renewed sense of passion once more!</p>
<p>Lastly, a look at where the site has come from, and where it is currently:</p>
<p><strong>(Jekyll) Legacy V1 Site:</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Hugo) Current V2 Site:</strong></p>

<p>Thank you very much for reading!</p>
