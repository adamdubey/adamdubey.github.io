Welcome back.
Certainly glad you could find your way here! Clearly things look a bit different now running on Hugo than they did on the older Jekyll iteration of this site&amp;hellip;
So Why the change?
Mainly due to Jekyll being a maintaince nightmare at times, and I wanted to learn a new technology to reduce the bloat and maintanince.
Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a lot more posts and project write-ups that haven&amp;rsquo;t found thier way on here just yet due to time constraints (Bay Area commutes are no joke), however I&amp;rsquo;m working on changing this so that I am able to have the time to learn and write more - and of course publish!</description></item></channel></rss>
