      <description>Ahoy! Welcome back.
Certainly glad you could find your way here! Clearly things look a bit different now running on Hugo than they did on the older Jekyll iteration of this site.
I wanted to really re-introduce this project properly this launch since sadly, when I launched the first iteration I didn&#39;t really have much free time to work on passion projects or write about various technologies.
Why is this going to be any different?</description>

      <description>With a few hours to kill on a lazy Sunday afternoon&amp;hellip;
GitHub Pages makes it very easy to quickly deploy a web application that only needs a front-end, which is a great medium to use if you for example, wanted to showcase an app or two for an online web developer portfolio.
While you can pretty much use any front-end framework and deploy to GitHub Pages, I&#39;ve chosen to use React.</description>
