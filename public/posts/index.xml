      <description>Ahoy! Welcome back.
Certainly glad you could find your way here! Clearly things look a bit different now running on Hugo than they did on the older Jekyll iteration of this site.
I wanted to really re-introduce this project properly this launch since sadly, when I launched the first iteration I didn&#39;t really have much free time to work on passion projects or write about various technologies.
Why is this going to be any different?</description>
