## Welcome!

I'm Adam, welcome to my slice of the Internet! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a background in Computer Science and Network Engineering. I have an endless passion and curiosity to create and tinker with various hardware and software based projects. My aim is to  entertain and share my experiences working with technology - which is the purpose of this website!

Stay tuned & as always,
