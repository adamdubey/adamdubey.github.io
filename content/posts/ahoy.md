## Ahoy!

**Welcome back.**

Certainly glad you could find your way here! Clearly things look a bit different now running on Hugo than they did on the older Jekyll iteration of this site.

I wanted to really re-introduce this project properly this launch since sadly, when I launched the first iteration I didn't really have much free time to work on passion projects or write about various technologies.

**Why is this going to be any different?**

Aside from a less bloaty maintaince headache[^1], I've found myself once again appreciating writing about various project endevors and reflections of working with various technologies in both professional and personal capcacities.

[^1]: I really do apprechiate Jekyll and Ruby, sometimes the ecosystem can just become a nightmare to wade through... (⌐■_■) _looking at you, Nokogiri_

**Stay tuned.**

Hopefully you'll be entertained, or even find something of use/help!
