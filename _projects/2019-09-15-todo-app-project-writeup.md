A journey of building and deploying projects on gh-pages.

_With a few hours to kill on a lazy Sunday afternoon..._

I wanted to catch up on some old todo's that have long been lingering on my kanban board, and one task was to clean up an old FTP drive that was scheduled to be sunset. A quick perusal of the drive had conjured up some old demo applications that had some neat features I wanted to preserve as they reminded me of some different challenges I've encountered on my full-stack web development journey. So in the spirit of refactoring, why not build a new project reusing some of the snippets to make a todo-app and breath some new life into this blog site project.

```
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

a. Create new "project warehousing" repo
b. Add a new demo application to repo and publish to gh-pages
c. Document and update this post

- TODO: Add more projects & write-ups!
```

Of the objectives outlined,  `objective b.` was the one I was truly excited to tackle, as it was really neat to see the app come to life when it came time to deploy it. Github pages really makes it easy to quickly demo a front-end web application to add to your project portfolio.

Overall, it was nice to finally get around to breathing some new life into these projects, and knock out some tasks on the board to inspire new projects. Sometimes taking the time to do a _"digital cleanse"_ and really assessing which projects, tasks, and old archival data can be purged really does help open up the door to gaining time for personal projects that do matter and are fun to learn from.

Glad I've gotten around to working on this one, until next time...
