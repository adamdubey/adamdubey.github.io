Move over Alexa, Bad Janet is here now.

# A trip to the Good Place

What a wonderful show! I think Janet has to be my favorite character, and her bad side was so good, I just had to immortalize her to randomly insult my guests because hey, who doesn’t want their Amazon Echo devices to insult friends and family every now and again?!

## Building your own Alexa skill

If you have an Amazon Echo device, I highly encourage you to try this out!

First, let’s cover the prerequisites:

- [Amazon Developer Services account](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa)
- Registering your device with your development account

AWS has some pretty comprehensive guides on getting those two prerequisites setup, which is outside of the scope for this project.

Once you have your account and device ready to go, navigate to the Alexa Skills Builder console and get ready to create a new skill!

Following the New Skill Wizard, be sure to select the Custom model, and “Alexa-hosted” for the backend. Now for the fun part - building Bad Janet!

## Bad Janet

In the show, Bad Janet has some pretty great quips and rips. While I could care less about the later, it’s the quips we are after!

But first, let’s get an understanding of what happens whenever we invoke this skill.

Essentially, when Alexa hears the specific keywords and skill invocation name, a random quote is grabbed from the predefined list of quotes and given back to the user - you.

Here is an example of what Bad Janet’s quote list looks like:

```js
const data = [
  "All trains today are delayed by three hours, just like they are everyday. All passengers, you all suck",
  "Why don't you roll off your mom and do it yourself you fat dynk",
  "What's crackin nut butts",
  "Go lick your dad's salty nuts you fat dynk!",
];
```

Once you’re happy with the list, that’s pretty much it - time to test!

## Testing and Usage

To test within the alexa development console, navigate to `TEST` and inside of the simulator window, type in your skill's invocation name, for example `open bad janet`.

Just be sure that you are happy with enunciation and retorts, it’s pretty common to actually spell things incorrectly to encourage the correct enunciation of certain words - there are loads of articles if you care enough to browse within the development console knowledgebase.

So onto the usage...there isn’t much to cover, especially since steps have been taken to associate your physical device with your development account, go ahead and ask Alexa to open your new skill!

## Welcome to Neighborhood 12358W!

I hope this project inspires you to go on and explore a new playground interacting with your smart devices! While there are many different types of skills to have a go with, I personally think this is a fun introduction into Amazon’s vast ecosystem as well as a good start towards working on obtaining AWS’ Alexa Skills Builder certification - Good Luck, and don’t fork it up!
